# example configuration file

# DATA is specified as type {PE,JUMP,OTHER,PACBIO} and 5 fields:
# 1)two_letter_prefix 2)mean 3)stdev 4)fastq(.gz)_fwd_reads
# 5)fastq(.gz)_rev_reads. The PE reads are always assumed to be
# innies, i.e. --->.<---, and JUMP are assumed to be outties
# <---.--->. If there are any jump libraries that are innies, such as
# longjump, specify them as JUMP and specify NEGATIVE mean. Reverse reads
# are optional for PE libraries and mandatory for JUMP libraries. Any
# OTHER sequence data (454, Sanger, Ion torrent, etc) must be first
# converted into Celera Assembler compatible .frg files (see
# http://wgs-assembler.sourceforge.com)

PARAMETERS
#set this to 1 if your Illumina jumping library reads are shorter than 100bp
EXTEND_JUMP_READS=0
#this is k-mer size for deBruijn graph values between 25 and 127 are supported, auto will compute the optimal size based on the read data and GC content
GRAPH_KMER_SIZE = auto
#set this to 1 for all Illumina-only assemblies
#set this to 1 if you have less than 20x long reads (454, Sanger, Pacbio) and less than 50x CLONE coverage by Illumina, Sanger or 454 mate pairs
#otherwise keep at 0
USE_LINKING_MATES = 0
#specifies whether to run mega-reads correction on the grid
USE_GRID=0
#specifies queue to use when running on the grid MANDATORY
GRID_QUEUE=hugemem.q
#batch size in the amount of long read sequence for each batch on the grid
GRID_BATCH_SIZE=300000000
#coverage by the longest Long reads to use
LHE_COVERAGE=30
#this parameter is useful if you have too many Illumina jumping library mates. Typically set it to 60 for bacteria and 300 for the other organisms
LIMIT_JUMP_COVERAGE = 300
#these are the additional parameters to Celera Assembler.  do not worry about performance, number or processors or batch sizes -- these are computed automatically.
#set cgwErrorRate=0.25 for bacteria and 0.1<=cgwErrorRate<=0.15 for other organisms.
CA_PARAMETERS =  cgwErrorRate=0.15
#minimum count k-mers used in error correction 1 means all k-mers are used.  one can increase to 2 if Illumina coverage >100

#whether to attempt to close gaps in scaffolds with Illumina data
CLOSE_GAPS=1
#auto-detected number of cpus to use
NUM_THREADS = 95
#this is mandatory jellyfish hash size -- a safe value is estimated_genome_size*estimated_coverage
JF_SIZE = 200000000
#set this to 1 to use SOAPdenovo contigging/scaffolding module.  Assembly will be worse but will run faster. Useful for very large (>5Gbp) genomes from Illumina-only data
